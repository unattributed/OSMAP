# Decision Log

## 2026-03-27

### Keep planning artifacts public and non-sensitive

The repository will keep a public documentation map under `docs/`, including
placeholder documents for planned work. Those placeholders should contain
minimal public-safe text rather than private planning detail or empty file
stubs.

### Complete Phase 0 with public-safe formal outputs

The project now treats Phase 0 as complete enough to proceed because the
charter, constraints, assumptions, roadmap, and early acceptance criteria are
documented in reviewable form.

### Ground Phase 1 in live-system evidence

Phase 1 documentation will be based on read-only inspection of the existing mail
host rather than inferred architecture alone. This keeps the replacement effort
anchored to operational reality.

### Preserve the current VPN-first access model as the starting point

The current environment intentionally keeps webmail, IMAP, and authenticated
submission behind WireGuard and nginx allowlisting. OSMAP should treat that as
the baseline security posture and only relax it by explicit later-phase design
decision.
