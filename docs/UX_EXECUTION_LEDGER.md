# OSMAP UX execution ledger

## Initial planning record — 2026-09-15

- Epic: OSMAP-UX, proposed plan revision 1.
- Operator requested full-functional UX/backend/OpenPGP planning with every-page
  dark mode. This record does not claim execution authorization for a slice.
- Source baseline: `b97d65c0f03c695ae11dbfe029d1926027f54409`.
- Accepted plan trust anchor: **PENDING operator acceptance of signed delivery**.
- S00–S11: **NOT_STARTED**, four slices each, 48 remaining.
- Current implementation slice: none. First candidate: **S00-01**.
- D01–D06: unresolved; recommendations are not approvals.
- Live authority for this epic: none recorded. No Vultr or obsd1 mutation.
- Existing local host alias/environment edits: unrelated; preserve and exclude.
- TOTP recovery/cleanup follow-ups have retained evidence in
  `/home/foo/Downloads/osmap-totp-lifecycle/`; bringing those facts into the
  repository is scoped to S00-04, not silently claimed by this planning delivery.
- Roundcube removal: operator-reported current fact; no restoration/migration work.
- Planning evidence root: `/home/foo/Downloads/osmap-ux-s00/`.
- Next action: review signed plan; accept anchor and assign S00-01.

## Append-only execution entry template

Copy the following for each transition. Do not replace historical observations
with later outcomes. Correct errors using a new entry referencing the old one.

- Timestamp / slice / previous state / new state:
- Operator instruction and accepted plan commit:
- Dependencies and approved Dxx records:
- Work-order allowed files, behavior and exclusions:
- Live target/account/action/window authority (or NONE):
- Tests: exact commands, statuses, findings, optional skips:
- Evidence: paths, SHA-256, assessed source and runtime hashes:
- Migration/rollback and cleanup/retained state:
- Signed delivery SHA and signature result:
- Operator acceptance reference:
- Sync approval/state/local-remote equality:
- Deployment approval/state (separate from sync):
- Blocker or exact next safe action:

## Autonomous engineering mandate — 2026-09-29

- Operator instruction: complete as much of the UX epic, sprints and slices as
  possible in the day-long work window; "you own this engineering entirely";
  full authority on parrot-2TB and obsd1.blackbagsecurity.com; check-in at
  midnight October 1 (America/Toronto). This explicit implementation mandate
  supersedes the original planning-only scope and per-slice stop-and-wait
  workflow. It delegates engineering decisions and continued implementation.
- Accepted execution baseline: signed plan commit
  `74522e5f99024720a3c47a3744207ff453de5731`, Shopkeeper signature verified;
  current manifest equals the signed manifest and all three plan hashes pass.
  Plan revision 1 remains unchanged. This records authority to execute, not
  retrospective human usability acceptance or a completed release.
- Source baseline: `2a6993fe7df42a57f0cbb5fe3e33e331b400fef9`; clean checkout
  at intake. Task branch: `feat/ux-completion-20260929`; prior signed portability
  change preserved. No remote write or production qualification is inferred.
- Review checkpoints become signed, evidence-backed local deliveries followed
  by continued work under the mandate. Human-only identity/accessibility
  acceptance remains pending wherever required. No subagents are authorized.
- Host authority: local engineering on parrot-2TB and bounded implementation,
  synthetic qualification and reversible OSMAP deployment on obsd1 only.
  Each live work order must identify accounts, operations, rollback and cleanup
  before mutation. Vultr and real external recipients remain excluded.

### S00-01 work order — IN_PROGRESS

- Base and trust anchor: as above. Dependencies: verified plan and operator
  implementation mandate. No runtime or live mutation in this slice.
- Allowed files: this ledger; `docs/UX_S00_INTAKE.md`; documentation index and
  governance classification needed for that document; `src/http/ux_fixtures.rs`
  and its test-only module declaration in `src/http.rs`; test-only screenshot
  tooling under `maint/ux/`. Runtime behavior is excluded.
- Deliverable: hash and inspect the four exact source images; enumerate their
  controls, existing routes/pages/errors and source/test anchors; capture
  synthetic baseline pages using real route rendering with a test gateway.
- Fixtures: synthetic `.test` identities and mail only, no host connection;
  redact fixture session/CSRF values from retained HTML; no secrets or real mail.
- Evidence root: `/home/foo/Downloads/osmap-ux-s00/run-20260929/`.
- Validation: fixture route status/CSP assertions, local browser screenshots,
  `git diff --check`, `make security-check`, `make acceptance-check`,
  `make v10-check`, `make v14-check`; actual exit status retained. Optional
  environment skips remain explicit. No strict-release claim.
- Rollback: source-only revert of the signed slice; no state migration.
- Next: complete intake and baseline evidence, sign delivery, then continue
  S00-02 under the explicit autonomous mandate.

### S00-01 verification — 2026-09-29 — VERIFIED

- Four original reference hashes match the plan; individually inspected.
  `UX_S00_INTAKE.md` records every pictured control, routes, actual gaps and
  existing behavioral anchors. Source/Reply All are absent despite historical
  claims. No runtime behavior changed.
- Fifteen synthetic route cases passed, with 45 Edge 154.0.4258.37 screenshots
  at 360/768/1440 pixels. Retained route/capture JSON manifests contain content
  hashes. Visual inspection confirms the reader grid problem and mobile empty
  drafts overflow (534 pixels at a 360-pixel viewport), carried to S01/S02.
- `cargo test --lib ux_synthetic_route_baselines`, `cargo fmt --check`,
  `git diff --check`, `make acceptance-check` (including actual
  `make security-check`, V10/V11/V12/V13), `make v10-check` and
  `make v14-check` passed. Logs and `.exit` files are in the S00 run's `gates/`.
  Rust 1.94.1 / Cargo 1.94.1 / external test-only Playwright 1.58.0.
- The initial gate attempt failed on audit-inventory drift after five fixture
  expectations were added. Refreshed the existing generated V10 registers and
  linked claims hashes using their source scanners: 739 assumptions, zero
  high-relevance runtime entries after refinement. No scanner assertion was
  weakened. These three generated register files are within the work order's
  necessary governance-classification scope.
- Optional V15 nginx runtime check skipped because nginx is unavailable on the
  workstation. Authenticated WSTG skip-policy self-tests passed; no live
  authenticated WSTG or strict release is claimed. No live state touched.
- Signing checkpoint follows; delivery SHA is recorded in the next append-only
  entry. Continued engineering is authorized by the mandate; final human
  acceptance remains distinct. Sync/deployment: not performed.
